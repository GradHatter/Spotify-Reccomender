# Spotify-Reccomender

reccomend.py

This file takes a playlist link (exx. https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6qkb836mh9L5gbh53MOAF1?si=77f67c3ac2554332)

It will then output the name, artist, and link to the most similar (best) and least similar (worst) songs to that playlist.

The song_data.csv file in the zip folder contains the sogs that the recommend file can choose from. When a playlist url is added the reccomend.py file will also add the songs in the playlist that are not present in the song file to song_data.csv
